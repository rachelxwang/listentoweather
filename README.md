# Weather Vibes - Uncommon Hacks 2020 Project
An ambient "music" generator based on the real time weather of any given location.
Our website takes the user's IP location to get real time weather stats that feed into our Python program as parameters for our ambient music generator. To make things more interesting, a user can input any city from around the world to hear music generated from the weather stats of that city.
